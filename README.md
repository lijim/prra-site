A website prototype for Passaic River Rowing

Based in:
- Flask (python) as our webserver.  Our needs are simple (landing page, static files), so we choose something easy to boot up.
- Basic HTML/CSS/JS front-end layer.  We choose this over a CMS like WordPress so we can modify the site more freely without all the overhead of a CMS.
- Hosting on Heroku
